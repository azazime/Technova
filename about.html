                <h2>Our Story</h2>
                <p>
                    Founded in 2020, EcoClean Solutions was born from a passion for creating a cleaner world, both in our homes and for the environment. Our founders, Mark Kalu and John Uche, recognized the need for effective cleaning products that don't harm the planet.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Starting with a small line of all-natural, biodegradable cleaning products, we've grown to offer a full range of eco-friendly cleaning solutions and professional services. Our mission is to make it easy for everyone to maintain a clean, healthy home while reducing their environmental impact.
